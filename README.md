# giblets

> Because Electron should not handle mp3 encoding, it should just make noise. Sound capture and encodeing is best left to either linux on a proper output device. Giblets dictates primary tempo, a giblet will tap into that but with a unique repeating pattern. 

#### Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:9080
npm run dev

# build electron application for production
npm run build


# lint all JS/Vue component files in `src/`
npm run lint

```
